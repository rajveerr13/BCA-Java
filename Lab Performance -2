Task-1:

Imagine you are developing a Java application for a car rental agency. In this system, you have a class called Vehicle representing general properties and behaviors of vehicles.
Additionally, you have a subclass called Car, which extends the Vehicle class and adds specific features related to cars, such as the number of doors and the type of fuel.
While implementing methods in the Car class, you find yourself needing to differentiate between local variables, instance variables, and superclass variables.
1.	Explain the role and usage of the super keyword in Java. Provide examples illustrating how super can be used to access superclass members and invoke superclass constructors within a subclass like Car.
2.	Describe the significance of the this keyword in Java and how it differs from super. 
Give examples demonstrating the use of this to refer to instance variables and methods within the same class, and discuss scenarios where using this is necessary for disambiguation or clarification.

Task-2: 
a.	Recall the basic principles of exception handling in Java, give example of try-catch blocks and the handling of checked exception. 
b.  Write a program to demonstrate Interface and implements multiple interface in a java.
